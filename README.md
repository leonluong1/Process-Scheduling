# Process-Scheduling
This project takes any number of processes (represented as a start-time integer and total-time integer) and outputs how long each 
of four different scheduling algorithms will take to complete all the processes: First In, First Out; Shortest Jump First; Shortest 
Remaining Time; Multi-Level Feedback
